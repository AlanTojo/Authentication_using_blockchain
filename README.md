Blockchain-based Authentication
This project shows how the use of Blockchain allows to create a Blockchain-based authentication where the user's login data hash is stored in a smart contract.

What authentication is
Authentication is a security process through which a proof of identity or ownership is required. It allows a user owning an account login credentials to login to
their account while denying access to others. In most cases, the user's login information are stored in a server, therefore the authentication process is an interaction
between the user and a server, and since this can give access to sensitive information, the server in which login credential are stored must be secured. 
A blockchain-based authentication (BBA) is proposed in order to lower malicious access and increase security to the authentication process.
